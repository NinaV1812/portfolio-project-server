The aap is developed using React Native on the front-end. It has environments for a game admin(someone who starts a game and invites other players) and game participants. Players can join the game by using a game code. 

I used REST API and Sequelize ORM in order to build a back-end environment for my application.

I used method POST in order to create:
a new game;
new film that users like;
Update information in my DB after a new  game participant joins. 

Also, I used the method PATCH once to find movies based on chosen genres and return then to a client.  Additionally, this method was used to update information about films participating in a game.
